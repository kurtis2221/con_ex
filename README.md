# Console Extended

## Info
A library that makes the console work like a windows form with some limitations.
It looks best with raster fonts.
There is an experimental mouse control mode, but it's not too smooth. After Windows 10
it breaks when clicking with the default console settings.

## Usage
A demo project is included with most of its controls and usage.
